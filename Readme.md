This is my first side project ever. Made about half a year (or 1.5 yeard, I honestly can't remember) after I started programming
when I look at it I know how horrible I was at programming back then, at least that proves that I've improved.
Had to compile it using dev-cpp because it uses bad way of allocating array size, that allows using variable as the size.

There are more things that need to be changed, but all I wanted to change was the langauge, as originally it was created in Polish. I wanted to keep it as close to the original as possible.
